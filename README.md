# IOb-SoC-OpenCryptoHW

This project aims to develop reconfigurable open-source cryptographic hardware
IP cores for Next Generation Internet. With the Internet of Things upon us,
security and privacy are more important than ever. On the one hand, the risks
are high if the security and privacy features are exclusively implemented in
software. On the other hand, if implemented solely in hardware, it is impossible
to fix bugs or deploy critical updates, a threat to security and privacy. Hence,
we propose to use reconfigurable hardware, providing the flexibility of software
and the trustworthiness of hardware.  There have been proposals to implement
cryptographic IP cores using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGAs). However, the
FPGA configuration infrastructure is cumbersome and proprietary, increasing
device cost and compromising safety. Hacking into it requires first hacking the
deviceâ€™s configuration infrastructure and then hacking the algorithm itself,
which is way more complicated.  Therefore, we propose to use open-source
Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) instead of FPGAs. CGRAs have much
lighter configuration circuits and are not controlled by any private entity.

# Setup
Clone the repository and the submodules with:
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:IObundle/IOb-SoC-OpenCryptoHW.git
```
or using the url:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/IObundle/IOb-SoC-OpenCryptoHW.git
```

# PC Emulation
The IOb-SoC-OpenCryptoHW system can build and run an environment for PC with:
```
make pc-emul-run
```
This target performs the Short Message Test for Byte-Oriented `sha256()` 
implementations from the 
[NIST Cryptograpphic Algorithm Validation
Program](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program/secure-hashing).

The test vectors are a set of 65 messages from 0 to 64 byte length. The 
implementation program only receives the messages and outputs the corresponding
message digests (MD). An external script compares the implementation output with
the expected MD from the test vectors.

The implementation output can be checked manually from terminal and
`software/pc-emul/ethernet.log`

### Clean environment
To clean the workspace after PC emulation:
```
make pc-emul-clean
```
### Requirements
PC emulation program requires:
- Git
- Make
- gcc
- Python 3.6+

# RISCV Emulation
The IOb-SoC-OpenCryptoHW system can be emulated using a verilog simulator like icarus 
with:
```Make
# Test with all supported simulators
make test-sim
# Test with a specific simulator
make sim-test SIMULATOR=icarus
make sim-test SIMULATOR=verilator
```

### Clean environment
To clean the workspace after the RISCV emulation:
```
make test-sim-clean
```

### Requirements/Setup
RISCV emulation requires:
- PC Emulation requirements
- RISCV toolchain
    - Add the RISCV toolchain to you `PATH` variable in `$HOME/.bashrc`:
    ```
    export RISCV=/path/to/riscv/bin
    export PATH=$RISCV:$PATH
    ```
- Verilog simulator, for example: 
    - [icarus verilog](https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog)  
    - [verilator](https://github.com/verilator/verilator)

# FPGA Synthesis
The system can be synthetized for FPGA with:
```
make fpga-build
```

The synthesis results can be found in: `hardware/fpga/vivado/AES-KU040-DB-G`. 

### Clean environment
To clean the workspace after the FPGA execution:
```
make test-fpga-clean
```

### Requirements/Setup
FPGA execution requires:
- Supported FPGA board
- Setup environment for FPGA execution
    - Add the executable paths and license servers in `$HOME/.bashrc`:
    ```
    export VIVADOPATH=/path/to/vivado
    ...
    export LM_LICENSE_FILE=port@licenseserver.myorg.com;lic_or_dat_file
    ```
    - Follow [IOb-soc's README](https://github.com/IObundle/iob-soc#readme) for
    more installation details.

# Ethernet
The system supports ethernet communication using the 
[IOb-Eth core](https://github.com/IObundle/iob-eth).

Check [IO-Eth's README](https://github.com/IObundle/iob-eth#readme) for setup 
instructions and further details.

# Versat
### Versat Custom Functional Units
The acceleration of SHA application requires the design of custom functional
units (FUs). These FUs can be validated with unit tests by running the command:
```
make test-versat-fus
```
The custom FUs are in `hardware/src/units/`.

### Spinal HDL Version
Alternatively, the same FUs can be generated from SpinalHDL using the command:
```
make test-versat-fus SPINAL=1
```
The SpinalHDL sources are in `hardware/src/spinalHDL`.

#### SpinalHDL Setup
Check `hardware/src/spinalHDL/README.md` for more details to setup the
requirements to use SpinalHDL.

### Versat FPGA Synthesis
The Versat Accelerator can be synthetized with the command:
```
make fpga-build-versat
```
The log file can be reviewed in
`hardware/fpga/vivado/AES-KU040-DB-G/versat.log`.
The netlist file can be reviewed in
`hardware/fpga/vivado/AES-KU040-DB-G/iob_versat.edif`.
