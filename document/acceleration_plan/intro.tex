This document outlines an acceleration plan for the SHA256 application
execution in the IOb-SoC-SHA system.

The document is divided in two parts: 
\begin{itemize}

\item the first part presents profiling data for the SHA256 application running
exclusively on the riscv CPU.

\item the second part elaborates on the profiling conclusions and establishes
functional unit architectures to accelerate the application.

\end{itemize}
