This document presents the SHA256~\cite{SHA_NIST_FIPS} acceleration plan
running on the IOb-SoC-SHA system~\cite{iob-soc-sha}, according to Milestone 7
of the OpenCryptoHW project.

The IOb-SoC-SHA system consists of a VexRiscV processor~\cite{VexRiscv}, the
IOb-Eth MAC core~\cite{iob-eth}, and the IOb-Versat CGRA~\cite{iob-versat} to
accelerate the cryptography algorithms.

First the document briefly introduces the sha256 cryptographic algorithm. Then
the execution profile of a purely software implementation run on the Vex RiscV
CPU is derived and discussed.

Based on the profile results, a hardware accelerator using the Versat CGRA is
proposed. The CGRA can morph into a different acceleration to support other
algorithms. The proposed system is analysed and an expected acceleration of
almost seven times compared to software is derived.

This non-FPGA reconfigurable hardware implementation not only improves
performance but also increases security and decreases energy consumption.
