Simple clock generator for ETHERNET peripherals.

This generator is used to connect two ETHERNET peripherals to each other, by providing them with a system generated clock.
This generator has 6 outputs, 3 for each ETHERNET peripheral. The 3 signals are PLL\_LOCKED (always set), RX\_CLK and TX\_CLK.
